									<h3>History and Culture</h3>
									<p align="justify"> As the Queen of the Arabian Sea, Kochi has welcomed ships from Asian and European nations to her harbour since the 14th century. 
										International traders and travellers were received with welcoming arms and minds. This significantly aided in its development as a 
										cosmopolitan city. As the state's commercial capital, it is an evolving cosmopolitan metropolis with vibrant life in the streets, movie 
										theatres, shopping centres, and skyscrapers. It also has a distinct sense of style from the rest of the state, whether in terms of clothing 
										or way of life.
									</p>
									<p align="justify"> Others view Kochi as a city with rich historical roots and streets that ooze an old-world elegance; a city with stunning monuments and a 
										diverse population of linguistic and ethnic groups, including Jews, Konkinis, Gujaratis, and others. Another group sees Kochi as a booming, 
										expanding market that offers chances for development and fortune to all who approaches her doors. In summary, Kochi offers a fusion of 
										modernity, old-world beauty, and a worldly perspective that simultaneously encourages continuity and change.

										<h3>fort kochi</h3>
										
									</header>
									<p align="justify" class="image"><span class="image right"><img src="images/fort kochi.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										You will be immediately whisked back in time to a different era as soon as you step foot in Fort Kochi. This area is rich in culture and history. 
										One can see Fort Immanuel while strolling via K. J. Herschel Road. Built in 1503, this ancient Portuguese stronghold serves as a reminder of the 
										Maharaja of Cochin and the Portuguese monarch's partnership. Another must-see location is Vasco House, which is thought to have been the explorer's 
										actual home. It is one of Kochi's most historic Portuguese structures.

									<h3>Kerala Folklore Museum</h3>

									</header>
									<p align="justify" class="image"><span class="image right"><img src="images/kerala folklore museum.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										The best illustration of traditional Kerala architecture is seen in this unique museum. Clay tiles, laterite stone, and wood make up the 
										building's exterior. More than 6000 pieces of art are housed in the greatest ethnic collection in a museum. The museum specialises in Indian 
										folk art and offers these priceless items with stories about their age, material, and historical significance.

									<h3>Bolghatty Island</h3>

									</header>
									<p align="justify" class="image"><span class="image right"><img src="images/Bolghatty & Vypeen Islands.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										A short boat journey from Kochi's mainland is Bolghatty Island, which is home to Bolghatty Palace, one of the oldest Dutch palaces still 
										standing outside of Holland. The former Bolghatty Palace is now a hotel with a swimming pool, 9-hole golf course, ayurvedic centre, and daily 
										Kathakali performances. It is a well-liked resort for Indian and foreign tourists.

									<h3>Cherai & Vypeen beach</h3>

									</header>
									<p align="justify" class="image"><span class="image right"><img src="images/Cherai & Vypeen beach.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										Another island that is extremely popular with travellers to Kochi and Kerala is Vypeen Island. Pallipuram Fort, the first European-made fort 
										still standing in India, was built in 1503 and is also located in Vypeen. One of Kerala's best beaches, Cherai beach, also known as Princess 
										of the Arabian Sea, is located just off the coast of Vypeen Island. It is shallow, peaceful, and perfect for swimming and sunbathing.

									<h3>Edappally Church Complex</h3>

									</header>
									<p align="justify" class="image"><span class="image right"><img src="images/Edappally Church Complex.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										The church, which is one of Kerala's oldest, is thought to have been established around 593 AD. The Virgin Mary was originally honoured in the 
										construction of this cathedral. Originally known as Mareth Church, its name changed as the city's cultures changed throughout the years and to 
										Edbali Church. As part of St. George's Day, a festival is annually held in this church for nine days. This church is one of the most well-known 
										tourist attractions in the area since both residents and visitors—both Christians and non-Christians—frequent it.
